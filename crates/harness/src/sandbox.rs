//! OS sandbox that wraps the Pi subprocess (ADR 0030).
//!
//! Boundary enforcement that an in-process membrane cannot provide: a `bash`
//! tool (or any exec tool) spawns a child with the same OS authority, whose
//! syscalls gaugewright never sees. The fix is to run the **whole `pi --mode rpc`
//! process** — and therefore every child it spawns — under an OS sandbox. One
//! uniform [`SandboxPolicy`]; per-OS [`Sandbox`] backends.
//!
//! The key property: the agent's method-definition surface is passed as a
//! `read_only_root` *inside* the writable worktree, so `bash`, `edit`, `write`,
//! `chmod`, and `rm` all fail at the kernel uniformly (`INV-24`). `bash` keeps
//! full power everywhere else. Filesystem integrity + workspace confinement are
//! what this discharges.
//!
//! Network is **deny-by-default** (RF-B3), with three postures (CORE-5):
//! [`Network::Deny`] (isolated, loopback only), [`Network::Filtered`] (egress ONLY
//! to [`SandboxPolicy::allowed_hosts`], enforced by the host-filtering egress
//! proxy in [`crate::egress_proxy`] routed as the netns's sole outbound path), and
//! [`Network::Allow`] (UNFILTERED — reaches any host). `Filtered` is the load-
//! bearing default a non-isolated project runs under: `allowed_hosts` names the
//! model endpoints and nothing else is reachable.
//!
//! **Fail-closed realization (honest boundary).** `Filtered` is only enforceable
//! where the netns can be given a proxy-only outbound path — bubblewrap plus a
//! rootless userspace-net helper (`slirp4netns`/`pasta`). Where that routing is
//! not available (or not yet verified — see [`FILTERED_ROUTING_VERIFIED`]),
//! `Filtered` **degrades to [`Network::Deny`]** (isolated), NEVER silently to
//! unfiltered `Allow`: an unenforceable filter fails to *no* egress, not *open*
//! egress. Declaring hosts via [`SandboxPolicy::allow_hosts`] alone still records
//! *intent* only. Unfiltered egress remains a conscious operator opt-in via
//! [`SandboxPolicy::allow_unfiltered_egress`] (env
//! `GAUGEWRIGHT_ALLOW_UNFILTERED_EGRESS=1`), mirroring `GAUGEWRIGHT_SANDBOX=0`.

/// (RF-B2): unlike the Linux/macOS backends, there is no CLI wrapper to shell out
/// to, so this must be a Win32 FFI backend and cannot be built or verified on the
/// Linux-only toolchain/CI this project runs. `wrap` returns `None`, which is now

/// when a protected definition surface cannot be sandboxed (RF-B1) — so the
/// Windows hole is shut today; this backend is the *enforcement* that lets
/// use-mode actually run on Windows.
///
/// Design when a Windows host is available:
/// - create a per-engagement **AppContainer profile** (a capability SID), and
///   launch Pi with `CreateProcess` + `STARTUPINFOEX`/`PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_*`
///   carrying the AppContainer SID and an explicit (empty/minimal) capability set;
/// - grant the AppContainer SID write access only to `writable_roots` (ACLs), and
///   add an explicit **deny-write ACE** for the AppContainer SID on each
///   `read_only_roots` path so the method-definition surface is unwritable even to
///   `bash`/PowerShell children (the INV-24 property the Linux backend gets from
///   `--ro-bind`);
/// - map `Network::Deny` to withholding the `internetClient` capability (no
///   outbound sockets); a non-empty `allowed_hosts` keeps the capability and
///   leaves per-host filtering to the egress proxy, as on the other backends.
