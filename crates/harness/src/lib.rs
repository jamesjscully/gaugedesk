//! gaugewright harness seam — the adapter-free runtime contract.

//! mediation chokepoint, the [`Observation`]/[`TurnOutcome`] turn evidence, the
//! [`ImageContent`] content block, and the OS [`sandbox`] (ADR 0030). Adapters
//! (`gaugewright-pi-bridge` is the Pi one) depend on this crate for the seam;
