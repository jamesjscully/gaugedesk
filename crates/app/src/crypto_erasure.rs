//! Crypto-erasure for content behind handles (`SECAUD-6`, GDPR right-to-erasure /
//! SOC 2 Confidentiality C1.2 & Privacy).
//!
//! The event log is **append-only and immutable** (`INV-6`), and the content-erasure
//! lifecycle deliberately *preserves history* (`HISTORY_PRESERVED`,
//! [`content_erasure`](gaugewright_core::content_erasure)) — so a tombstone makes a
//! payload *unresolvable for future use* but does **not** shred the bytes. For a true
//! right-to-erasure ("the data is gone, unrecoverable"), shredding bytes in the
//! immutable log is not an option.
//!
//! **Crypto-erasure** reconciles the two. Each erasable unit's content is sealed under
//! its **own** data key. Erasing destroys that key, so the ciphertext that remains in
//! the immutable log becomes **permanently unrecoverable** — the payload is gone, yet
//! history (the handle, the sealed bytes, the audit metadata) is intact. The keys live
//! in **mutable** storage (a keyring — KMS-sealed in production via `SEC-4`); the
//! content lives in the immutable log. Deleting a key never touches the log, so `INV-6`
//! holds *and* the payload is unrecoverable. This is the concrete realization of the
//! model's `TOMBSTONE_BLOCKS_FUTURE_RESOLUTION` for the case where unrecoverability —
//! not merely non-resolution — is required.
