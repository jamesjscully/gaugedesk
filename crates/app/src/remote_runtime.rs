//! Remote runtime observation return (RT-1 / OBSERVATION-FEDERATION-1): a runtime
//! at a **non-local placement** returns its execution observations to the owning
//! admission shell *through federation* (FED-2), where they become run evidence
//! only when the **owner** admits them (`INV-4`).
//!
//! A remote-placed runtime is reached as a [`RemoteHarness`] (`REMOTE-RPC-1`): the
//! turn runs in a *different* trust authority and its [`Observation`]s come back
//! across the `PROTO-1` RPC envelope. Those observations are **not** local truth —
//! they cross the owner's bridge as signed federated messages over the
//! [`FederationRelay`] seam (`RELAY-TRAIT-1`, `INV-21`), and only the **owner's**
//! `RecordObservation` admission turns each one into standing run state (`INV-4`).
//! The relay is transport only: it never writes the run fact and holds no payload
//! basis (`INV-13`/`INV-14`), and only the observation's **handle** crosses, never
//! its body (`INV-10`).
//!
//! Exercised in the loopback two-authority shape; a real cross-machine runtime is
//! the `D-REMOTE` follow-on, and TEE-attested placement is `D-ATTEST` — the return
//! mechanism is the same regardless.
