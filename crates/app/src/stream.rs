//! The live event stream: operational + admitted events pushed to the
//! workbench as they happen, so the client transcript is a true *reduction of
//! the server stream* (`app-stack.md`) rather than client-invented truth.
//!
//! Wire shape matches `web/src/state/transcript.ts`'s `StreamEvent` union so the
//! client reducer consumes it directly. Transport is SSE over the same loopback
//! control plane; a `tokio::broadcast` per engagement fans events to subscribers
//! (and drops silently when no one listens — events are also durable in the log).
