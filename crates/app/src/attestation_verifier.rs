//! Attestation quote verification seam (ATTEST-3): the `QuoteVerifier` trait the
//! app layer calls to turn an [`AttestationQuote`] into a
//! [`QuoteVerificationResult`], plus the loopback-first implementations.
//!
//! Attestation is a **boundary modifier**, not a separate runtime (ADR 0040): an
//! attested host presents a quote over the [`CodeMeasurement`] of its image; the
//! verifier decides whether that quote is trustworthy *before* the boundary gate
//! releases any sealed key (ATTEST-5). The core carries the typed evidence; the
//! *parsing of opaque report bytes and the trust decision live here*, behind the
//! seam, exactly like the federation relay (`RELAY-TRAIT-1`).
//!
//! - [`LoopbackVerifier`] is the buildable-now impl: honest in-process checks
//!   (nonce freshness, measurement allow-list, well-formed report bytes) with no
//!   TEE hardware. It is what the loopback two-authority shape and the e2e
//!   attested-boundary flow run against.
//! - [`StubVerifier`] is a placeholder that accepts every well-formed quote — a
//!   fixture for tests that exercise the *downstream* gate (key release) without
//!   caring about the verdict path. It is never the default.
//!
//! Real TEE verifiers (SEV-SNP / TDX / Nitro / SGX) attach behind [`QuoteVerifier`]
//! with no rearchitecture: they replace the report-bytes check with real signature
//! chaining to an Intel/AMD root and real report parsing (ATTEST-15, needs-infra).
