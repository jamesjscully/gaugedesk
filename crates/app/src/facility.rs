//! Facility — the attachable/revocable unit of hosted functionality (`ADR 0077`).
//!
//! A **facility** is what a web user adds to a tenant (or, for account-level ones, to
//! the person) that contributes a Console **surface** and/or a **connection to a home
//! node** and/or quiet **config**: cloud backup, a hosted home node, a registered host,
//! library sync. It is the unit the hosted-account Console is built from — the Console is
//! *core (account + tenant switcher) + the surfaces its facilities contribute*, with no
//! hardcoded section list. See
//! [`specs/primitives/facility.md`](../../../specs/primitives/facility.md).
//!
//! Like the [`crate::org`] directory and the [`crate::library`], these are durable
//! **records** folded latest-wins by id (`data.md`, `INV-5`/`INV-6`) — an `Upsert` sets,
//! a `Tombstone` removes — held as record kind [`FACILITY_KIND`] in the **owner's** scope:
//! a *tenant-level* facility in that tenant's [`crate::org::tenant_scope`], an
//! *account-level* one in the reserved [`crate::account::ACCOUNT_SCOPE`], so a facility is
//! scope-isolated to its owner (`INV-1`). This module is the pure data model + projection
//! (no `Workbench`/route deps); the attach/configure/revoke CRUD routes and their
//! role-gating (`rbac.rs`) live with the control-plane hub.
//!
//! Adds no protection invariant (ADR 0020): a facility organizes *access to* hosted
//! capability. **Attach is not access** — reaching the work is always the home admitting
//! you (`INV-13`), never the facility handing you a key (`INV-10`); the hub stays blind
//! (`INV-14`). The person's **devices** and **linked model key** are the account-level
//! facilities already modeled in [`crate::account`]; this module holds the *other*
//! attachable hosted units, which need their own record.
