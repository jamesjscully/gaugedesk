//! Loopback mobile bridge (MOB-006): a **device-bound remote-projection** flow,
//! driven end-to-end in one process over the same [`FederationRelay`] seam
//! (`RELAY-TRAIT-1`) every cross-authority/remote/mobile delivery rides.
//!
//! A paired mobile device reaches the owner's runtime through the federation
//! bridge: the owner declares a boundary ceiling and **binds the device** to its
//! bridge grant (`DeviceBinding`, MOB-001), pinning the typed
//! `(DeviceId, BridgeGrantId)` and the device key a later delivery must present.
//! A projection then crosses to the device as a federated message — but only the
//! resource **handle name** crosses, never the payload (`INV-10`): the device can
//! render a file tree of handle names with no granted basis, and the payload stays
//! behind the [`resource_access`](gaugewright_core::resource_access) grant.
//!
//! The crossing is **device-bound** (MOB-004): the delivery shell runs
//! `ValidateDeviceBinding` before it routes, so only the bound, still-active device
//! projects — a foreign device key or a revoked device is stopped before
//! admission, fail-closed (`INV-21`). A revoked device cannot keep projecting.
//!
//! Loopback only: both authorities and the device share one [`Store`]. A real
//! cross-machine mobile client attaches behind the same [`FederationRelay`] seam
//! with no rearchitecture (`MOBILE-PROJECTION-1`, ADR 0020).
