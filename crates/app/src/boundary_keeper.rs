//! Boundary keeper — the app-layer gate that turns an *attested* acceptance into
//! a trustworthy boundary admission + a sealed-key release (D-ATTEST / ADR 0040,
//! ATTEST-5).
//!
//! Attestation is a **boundary modifier**, not a separate runtime: the reducer's
//! decision logic is unchanged (`boundary_lifecycle`), but the ceiling
//! (`method_secret() == attested`) is only *honest* if the host actually proved
//! what code it runs before any sealed key reached it. That proof lives here, in
//! the app, behind two seams:
//!
//! - The [`QuoteVerifier`](crate::attestation_verifier) (ATTEST-3) turns the raw
//!   [`AttestationQuote`] a host presents into a
//!   [`QuoteVerificationResult`](gaugewright_core::attestation::QuoteVerificationResult).
//!   The keeper pairs quote + verdict into the
//!   [`AttestationEvidence`](gaugewright_core::attestation::AttestationEvidence) that
//!   rides in `BoundaryEvent::Accepted` (ATTEST-2) — so an attested acceptance is
//!   admitted *only* with evidence the verifier vouched for.
//! - The [`SealedKeyReleaseService`] (the KMS seam) releases the keys that unseal
//!   the workload's inputs — and only to a host whose carried evidence is
//!   trustworthy *for the very measurement the key is sealed to* (ATTEST-4/-6).
//!
//! [`accept_boundary_attested`] is the gate that composes them: verify the quote,
//! drive the boundary `Accept` with the resulting evidence, then release the
//! sealed keys gated on that same evidence. A rejected quote never admits the
//! acceptance and never releases a key — the ceiling never over-promises.
//!
//! This is the buildable-now loopback shape: [`LoopbackKeyReleaseService`] is an
//! in-memory key store with no real KMS. A real KMS (Azure Key Vault / AWS KMS /
//! GCP KMS) that binds sealing to attestation attaches behind
//! [`SealedKeyReleaseService`] with no change to the gate (ATTEST-15, needs-infra),
//! exactly like the federation relay and the quote verifier.
