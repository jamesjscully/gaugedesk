//! The v1 onboarding "package" and the app→whip event bridge (ADR 0075 Phase 2).
//!
//! The onboarding tracker is a flat checklist filed into the account-global
//! boundary's [`WhipTrackerHandle`]. Each step is one `WorkItem` in the
//! `onboarding` queue, tagged with a `metadata.step` key. App events
//! (credential connected, first turn, project created) drive two things,
//! best-effort:
//!
//! 1. a provenance event ingested into the boundary's `RuntimeKernel` (the
//!    durable "why did this close" trail), and
//! 2. closing the matching open checklist item.
//!
//! v1 keeps the *advancement* logic in Rust rather than a compiled whip program
//! whose rules lower `std.tracker` effects — that (Phase 2b) is deferred with the
//! rest of the rules engine (ADR 0075 §Consequences: the tracker is the interim
//! thin row store, sufficient for a flat checklist). The `RuntimeKernel` is still
//! stood up per boundary and carries the event stream, so Phase 2b is a swap of
//! the driver, not a new surface.
//!
//! Advancement is **best-effort by contract**: seeding or advancing onboarding
//! must never fail the real operation that triggered it (saving a credential,
//! running a turn, creating a project). Every entry point swallows tracker
//! errors after logging them.
