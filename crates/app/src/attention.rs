//! The **attention policy** (ATTN-2, ADR 0082 §3): a shallow, operator-owned
//! rules document mapping each *signal* a chat can raise to an attention level.
//!
//! Deliberately shallow — signal → attention, nothing else — and it stays that
//! way: it is presentation, not policy (ADR 0080: WhippleScript owns policy
//! language; the moment this wants predicates over labels or resources it must
//! ride the advancement path instead, ATTN-3). The document lives in the
//! account-settings KV under [`ATTENTION_RULES_SETTING`] so it syncs like every
//! other operator preference and a future LLM layer can write it against a
//! schema this module is the single evaluator of.
//!
//! Parsing is total: a missing, malformed, or partially-unknown document
//! degrades to the shipped defaults per signal — the queue never breaks because
//! a config was hand-edited (or LLM-written) badly.
