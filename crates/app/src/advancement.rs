//! The **advancement policy** (ATTN-3, ADR 0082 §4–5): operator rules deciding,
//! at settle, whether a turn's clean merge **auto-advances** to `main` or
//! **holds** for human review.
//!
//! Advancement is a governance gate, so unlike the attention policy it is
//! **fail-closed everywhere**: no rules → hold; a rule that doesn't fully cover
//! the turn → hold; a fact that can't be resolved → hold. The only rule
//! vocabulary today is `writes-within` — advance when every file the turn
//! changed falls inside the operator's named path scopes — with two safety
//! conjuncts no configuration can waive:
//!
//! - **A config-touching diff never auto-advances.** `.agent-config.json` is
//!   where a policy loosening lives; the loosening review is a human gate
//!   (this is deliberately *stricter* than detecting loosening — a tightening
//!   holds too, and that's fine: fail toward holding).
//! - **An externally-tainted turn never auto-advances.** If the engagement has
//!   read any resource whose owner is not the chat's own authority (or whose
//!   owner can't be resolved), the outputs carry someone else's stake — the
//!   read-side guard over the runtime-certified read-set (ADR 0082 §4).
//!
//! Write-side facts come from GaugeDesk's own workspace diff, which is authoritative
//! **locally** (GaugeDesk owns the workspace repo). On a remote/managed
//! placement the receipt is the only authority — that is WhippleScript DR-0036
//! (workspace cut + dynamic guarantees); when it lands, these predicates
//! degenerate to matching cited guarantee names (ADR 0082 §5). GaugeDesk grows
//! no policy language here: the document is data, this module its one reader.
//!
//! Every auto-advance is admitted as ordinary merge events plus a transcript
//! citation naming the rule and the facts it matched — the audit trail says
//! *why* `main` moved without a human. Parsing is total: a malformed document
//! yields no rules, i.e. everything holds.
