//! Non-loopback network server seam (`SERVE-1`): the bind + governance-key auth
//! middleware the cross-machine [`FederationRelay`](crate::federation_relay)
//! attaches behind (ADR 0020).
//!
//! Two thin pieces, both **scaffold for the real network path**:
//!
//! 1. [`bind_net_server`] — binds a `TcpListener` to a **non-loopback** address
//!    (default `0.0.0.0:<ephemeral>`). The co-resident control plane in
//!    [`crate::open_runtime::open_serve`] binds loopback-only on purpose (single-user, no network);
//!    a federation relay must instead accept connections from another authority's
//!    machine, so it binds a routable interface. Here that is still the local box
//!    (no NAT, no rendezvous) — the real cross-machine relay
//!    (`RENDEZVOUS-STUB-1`) attaches the same listener behind this seam.
//!
//! 2. [`GovernanceAuth`] — governance-key authentication middleware. Every
//!    cross-authority call presents an [`AuthAttempt`]: the scope it targets and a
//!    signature over a canonical challenge. The server resolves the scope's owning
//!    authority via [`determine_scope_authority`] (the `SCOPE-AUTH-1` seam) and
//!    verifies the signature against that authority's **registered** governance key
//!    with the pure [`verify_signature`] predicate — **real P-256 ECDSA**,
//!    fail-closed (`gaugewright_core::signature`; the old `SIGN-1` length-only stub was
//!    replaced by P256-STUB-1). An unregistered authority or a bad signature is
//!    rejected; a forged signature cannot authenticate (CONF-4, verified stale).
//!
//! The auth boundary parses the untrusted request into typed identities at the
//! shell and hands the core only validated values (`principles.md` "Contracts at
//! the boundary").
