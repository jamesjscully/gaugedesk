//! Durable, engagement-scoped resource-metadata records (`data.md`).
//!
//! A [`ResourceRecord`] is a declarative fact, not lifecycle state: we persist it
//! as an append-only record (`kind = "resource"`) in the **engagement's** scope —
//! taint is engagement-scoped (ADR 0026), so a context resource opened into an
//! engagement is an engagement-scoped fact — and fold it **latest-wins by
//! `ResourceId`** into the current view, exactly as [`crate::library`] folds the
//! library. A newer write for the same id supersedes the older (a rename, a
//! re-ingest, or a [`tombstone`] all fall out of "append a newer record"); the full
//! history is preserved in the log (`INV-6`).
//!
//! Unlike the library's `Tombstone` op, a resource tombstone does **not** remove
//! the record: per [[content-erasure]] the handle, metadata, and history remain
//! while future payload resolution is blocked (`INV-18`). So the tombstone is a
//! `tombstoned: true` revision, still listed.
