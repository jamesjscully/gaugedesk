//! Measurement store — the reproducible-build seam (D-ATTEST / ADR 0040, ATTEST-10).
//!
//! Attestation only protects a method secret if the [`CodeMeasurement`] a host
//! attests to can be tied back to a *known, reproducible build*: a verdict of
//! "this host runs digest `abc…`" is worthless unless we already know that
//! `abc…` is the SHA-256 of an image we built from audited source. The
//! measurement store is that map — from a logical [`BuildId`] (an image ref +
//! version a reproducible build publishes) to the [`MeasurementRecord`] pinning
//! the measurement that build produces.
//!
//! Two reads sit on top of it:
//! - [`MeasurementStore::lookup`] — resolve one build to its pinned measurement.
//! - [`MeasurementStore::allow_list`] — the set of trusted measurements, which is
//!   exactly the allow-list a [`LoopbackVerifier`](crate::attestation_verifier)
//!   (and, later, a real TEE verifier) consults before a quote may verify
//!   (ATTEST-3) and before any sealed key is released to it (ATTEST-5).
//!
//! This is the buildable-now, in-memory loopback shape: the store is populated by
//! the operator registering the measurements they trust. The real impl attaches
//! behind the same surface — it ingests the SHA-256 measurements a reproducible
//! build CI/CD pipeline produces and publishes (ATTEST-15, needs-infra) — with no
//! change to callers, exactly like the federation relay and the quote verifier.
