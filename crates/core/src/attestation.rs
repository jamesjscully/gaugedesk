//! Attestation evidence — the typed records that ride an *attested* placement
//! (`Placement { attested: true }`, D-ATTEST / ADR 0040).
//!
//! Attestation is a **boundary modifier**, not a separate runtime: when a host
//! runs in a confidential VM, it produces an [`AttestationQuote`] over the
//! [`CodeMeasurement`] of the loaded image. A verifier turns that quote into a
//! [`QuoteVerificationResult`]; the accepted quote plus its verdict is the
//! [`AttestationEvidence`] that rides in `BoundaryEvent::Accepted` (ATTEST-2).
//!
//! These are pure domain types — never a bare `Vec<u8>`/`String` in the domain
//! (`principles.md` "Contracts at the boundary"). The real quote-generation and
//! signature verification happen at the imperative shell behind the
//! `QuoteVerifier` seam (ATTEST-3); the core only carries and decides over the
//! typed evidence. Real TEE verifiers (SEV-SNP / TDX / Nitro / SGX) attach
//! behind that seam with no change here — that hardware-bound work is DEFERRED
//! (see `DEFERRED.md` at the repo root; ATTEST-15, needs-infra).
