//! Projection freshness — the explicit currentness marker every cached
//! projection carries before it is shown to a client (ADR 0037, spec 015).
//!
//! The core decision (spec 015): projection uncertainty must be *explicit*. If
//! the system lacks basis to prove a current view it must not silently show old
//! state as current, nor collapse uncertainty into success/failure. So a
//! projection never travels bare — it travels as a `Freshness` carrying a
//! `FreshnessMarker` and the basis (`generated_at`) the marker was decided
//! against. The imperative shell materializes the clock; the core decides
//! whether a marker may be presented as live.
//!
//! This slice carries the five markers the mobile projection client
//! distinguishes (ADR 0037): the wider conceptual set in spec 015
//! (`current_snapshot`/`blocked`/`unsupported`/`offline`/`compacted`) lands with
//! the projection-carriage and connection-state work that consumes it.
