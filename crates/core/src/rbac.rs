//! Coarse RBAC for the **admin-console surface** — the workspace-administration
//! capability matrix (M3 `RBAC-3`, [ADR 0043](../../../specs/decisions/0043-enterprise-readiness-mid-market.md) §2).
//!
//! Two distinct role mechanisms live under "roles are coarse ABAC" (ADR 0032), and
//! they have **opposite default polarity** on purpose:
//!
//! - The **resource-floor** rules in [`crate::abac`] are *restrict-only*: they narrow
//!   a protection-floor `baseline` the floor already computed (`role = viewer ⇒ no
//!   export`). They can only *remove* a permission the floor granted.
//! - The **admin-console** matrix here is *positive, default-deny*: there is no
//!   protection floor behind "may this role invite a member" — the action either is
//!   or is not within the role's standing. So [`role_can`] grants only what the fixed
//!   matrix lists and denies everything else, including any unrecognized role
//!   (fail-closed, `INV-20`). This is the right shape for admin authorization; using
//!   the restrict-only evaluator (default-allow-then-narrow) would fail *open*.
//!
//! Both are "roles as attributes", not a parallel permission system: the fixed roles
//! are the same `owner`/`admin`/`member`/`viewer`/`billing` set, and custom roles +
//! a policy-authoring surface stay upmarket (ADR 0043 §3).
//!
//! See [`specs/primitives/organization.md`](../../../specs/primitives/organization.md)
//! and [`specs/models/rbac.qnt`](../../../specs/models/rbac.qnt) (the Quint oracle).
