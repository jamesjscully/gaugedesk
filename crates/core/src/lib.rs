//! gaugewright core — the pure, verified heart.
//!
//! Domain types and lifecycle reducers, with **no I/O**: reducers are the
//! `(decide, evolve)` pairs of ADR 0004, ported from the Quint models in
//! `specs/models/` and property-tested against the same invariants. The
//! imperative shell (store / boundary / pi-bridge / api / app) materializes all
//! non-determinism and authority before these reducers run.
//!
//! Contracts at the boundary (`principles.md`): identities are newtypes,
//! commands/events/states are enums — illegal states are unrepresentable, and
//! the core trusts its types rather than re-validating strings.

/// that consumes the result MUST fail closed on an unrecognized authority — e.g.
/// `net_server::GovernanceAuth::authenticate` looks the returned id up in its
/// registered-key map and rejects (`UnknownAuthority`) if absent, so a malformed
/// scope cannot authenticate. The only other consumer (`engine` output minting)
/// resolves system-constructed, well-formed scopes. A stricter `Option`-returning
/// signature is the eventual hardening (folded into the CORE-4 rename sweep), but is
/// not load-bearing today because the gate already fails closed.
