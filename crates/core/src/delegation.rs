//! Device subkey delegation — Model A authority identity (ADR 0039;
//! `remote-substrate.md` "Authority identity & keys").
//!
//! An authority's **stable public identity is its root key**. Each device holds a
//! short-lived **subkey** the root signs into a delegation: *"this subkey acts for
//! authority `<root>` until `<expiry>`"*. Federated envelopes are then signed by the
//! **subkey**, and a verifier checks two links: the delegation chains to the known
//! root (signed by it, unexpired), and the envelope verifies under the delegated
//! subkey. The single-key slice (no delegation) stays valid — a delegation is an
//! *optional* upgrade that does not change the authority's pinned root.
//!
//! **Multi-device / per-device revocation** falls out for free: add a device by
//! issuing it a subkey; revoke one by letting its subkey expire (or, durably, by a
//! root-signed revocation pushed over the bridge — deferred with the broader
//! revocation-distribution story). The authority's pinned root is unchanged either
//! way, so peers keep trusting the authority across device churn.
