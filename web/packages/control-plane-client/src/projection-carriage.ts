/**
 * `ProjectionCarriage<T>` — the wrapper every projection travels in on the wire
 * to the mobile (and desktop) client (ADR 0037, spec 015; MOB-007).
 *
 * The core decision: projection uncertainty must be **explicit** (mirrors
 * `gaugewright_core::freshness`). A projection never travels bare — it carries a
 * `Freshness` marker and the basis (`generatedAt`) the marker was decided
 * against, so the client can never silently render stale state as current. It
 * also carries the optimistic-reconcile correlation id (`clientRequestId`,
 * MOB-003): a projection produced in answer to a specific optimistic command
 * names that command so the client can retire its pending entry.
 *
 * Like the rest of the control-plane edge (`control-plane.ts`), the raw wire
 * shape is parsed here into a branded domain type; UI code consumes the parsed
 * `ProjectionCarriage<T>` and never the raw JSON (`principles.md`, "Contracts at
 * the boundary"; `INV-5`).
