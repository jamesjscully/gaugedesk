/**
 * The mobile **Content pane's** view-derived vocabulary (`mobile-client.md`,
 * MOB-016): the small, pure projections the {@link MobileContent} island needs
 * to paint the *payload* of the handle picked in the Files pane (MOB-015). The
 * cardinal rule the Files pane already encodes carries straight through here:
 * **holding a handle is not holding the payload** (`INV-10`, mirrors
 * `gaugewright_core::resource_access`). The Files pane lists every file by name; this
 * pane renders the *body* — and so it must make every reason a body is *not*
 * shown an **explicit, surfaced state**, never a silent blank.
 *
 * Two orthogonal axes decide what the pane shows:
 *
 *   1. **Access** (`AccessPhase`, reused from `mobile-files`): only a `granted`
 *      handle admits the payload. `init` / `requested` / `revoked` / `denied`
 *      each render their *own* access-denied panel (with the right affordance —
 *      request, wait, re-request, or a terminal explanation) rather than the
 *      content body.
 *   2. **Freshness** (`FreshnessMarker`, from the projection carriage): even a
 *      granted body may be `stale` / `partial` / `redacted` / `indeterminate`,
 *      a caveat that must surface as a banner over the body rather than read as
 *      current truth (mirrors `FreshnessMarker::is_current`, ADR 0037).
 *
 * The island is a thin renderer; every "what may I show, and how do I caption
 * it?" decision lives here as a pure function so it is testable without a DOM
 * (same split as `carousel-view.ts` / `CarouselIsland.tsx`, `mobile-files.ts` /
 * `MobileFiles.tsx`).
