/**
 * The mobile **Chat composer's** view-derived vocabulary (`mobile-client.md`,
 * MOB-020): the small, pure state the {@link MobileChat} island needs to paint a
 * draft → send/stop control at the `chat` carousel stop. Sending a message is one
 * of the few *commands* the client may issue (`mobile-client.md`, "Projection-first
 * compliance": "Only send / approve / reject … are commands"); everything else in
 * the carousel is local view state. So the composer is where the **optimistic
 * reconcile** discipline lives on the client edge.
 *
 * The model mirrors `gaugewright_core::run::pending_commands` (MOB-003) exactly:
 *
 *   - A **send** while a turn is running does not manufacture truth. It clears the
 *     draft and records an *optimistic* pending entry keyed by a fresh
 *     {@link ClientRequestId} (`principles.md`, `INV-5`: the client cannot
 *     manufacture truth — the entry is *non-standing* until the environment
 *     confirms, `mobile-client.md` "Optimistic UI carries a `clientRequestId`").
 *   - A projection answering that command arrives carrying its id
 *     ({@link ProjectionCarriage.clientRequestId}) and {@link reconcile}s the
 *     pending entry away — the same retire path `RunState::Reconcile` walks.
 *   - **Stop** is offered only while a turn is running (there is something to
 *     abort); like send it is a request, not a fact.
 *
 * Like {@link mobile-content} / {@link mobile-files} this is a thin, DOM-free pure
 * layer: every "what may I do, and what does this draft become?" decision is a
 * pure function here, and the {@link MobileChat} island only wires Solid signals
 * and DOM events onto it.
