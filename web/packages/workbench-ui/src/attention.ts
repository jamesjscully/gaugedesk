/**
 * The **attention policy** schema, client side (ATTN-2, ADR 0082 §3): which
 * signals a chat can raise, what each means to a human, and how the rules
 * document in the account-settings KV is read and written. The single server
 * evaluator lives in `crates/app/src/attention.rs`; this module mirrors its
 * schema and defaults so the settings surface renders from one vocabulary.
 *
 * Deliberately shallow — signal → attention, nothing else (presentation, not
 * policy; ADR 0080). Parsing is total: a missing/malformed document degrades to
 * the shipped defaults per signal.
