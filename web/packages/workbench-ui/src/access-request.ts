/**
 * The mobile **access-request flow** (`mobile-client.md`, MOB-030): the pure
 * state machine the {@link AccessRequestPanel} island reduces over when a user
 * asks for the *payload* behind a withheld handle in the Content pane (MOB-016).
 * It is where `INV-10` becomes an *action*: the Files pane shows a handle's name
 * and the Content pane refuses its body until access is granted; this flow is the
 * affordance that turns that refusal into a request the owner can approve.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the one the rest of the mobile client already speaks — the
 * payload-access {@link AccessPhase} (`mobile-files.ts`, mirroring
 * `gaugewright_core::resource_access::AccessPhase`). A request walks the same arc the
 * core reducer walks server-side: `init` (no ask) → the user submits → `requested`
 * (awaiting the owner's approval) → the owner answers → `granted` (the body is now
 * admitted), `denied` (terminal refusal), or — if a prior grant was withdrawn —
 * `revoked`. The flow never manufactures the granted fact: it is `granted` only
 * once the server's resource-access state says so (mirrors the pairing flow's
 * `paired ⇔ Active` discipline, `pairing.ts`; `principles.md`, `INV-5`).
 *
 * Like the rest of the mobile client (`mobile-content.ts`, `connection.ts`,
 * `pairing.ts`) this is a thin, DOM-free pure layer: every "what may the user do,
 * and what do we show?" decision is a pure function here, and the
 * {@link AccessRequestPanel} island only wires Solid signals and DOM events onto
 * it. The transport (the actual `request payload access` command to the owner) is
 * the host's; this module decides nothing about the network beyond folding the
 * phase it is handed.
 *
 * The optimistic-reconcile correlation id (`ClientRequestId`, MOB-003) travels
 * with a pending ask so the host can retire the optimistic `requested` entry when
 * the resource-access projection that answers it lands.
