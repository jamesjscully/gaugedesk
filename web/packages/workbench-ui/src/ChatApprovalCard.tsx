/**
 * The mobile **inline merge/review approval card** (`mobile-client.md`, MOB-031):
 * the card threaded into the chat transcript when a turn surfaces a result that
 * needs approval. It is the carousel's answer to the desktop {@link ReviewShelf}:
 * the same conjunctive-consent review lifecycle (`gaugewright_core::review`, `INV-7`),
 * but inline in the chat stop rather than a second shelf the phone has no room for.
 *
 * Like {@link AccessRequestPanel} / {@link MobileChat} / {@link Carousel} this is a
 * thin renderer: every "what may the user do, and what do we show?" decision is a
 * pure function in `chat-approval.ts` (`presentChatApproval`), so the component only
 * wires Solid's `<Switch>` / `<Show>` onto the derived presentation and never
 * decides the review itself (it never clears — clearance is the parties' conjunctive
 * consent, server-side).
 *
 * Consenting and releasing are *standing commands* (`INV-5`), so — exactly like the
 * {@link MobileChat} send — they are permitted only when the connection can carry
 * one ({@link canCommand}); a degraded link disables them here, paired with the
 * {@link ConnectionBanner} that explains why (MOB-028), never a silently dead button.
