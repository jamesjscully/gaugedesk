/**
 * The per-row **status gem** (WS-H): a compact kind glyph that doubles as the row's
 * status light. The glyph says *what kind* of row it is (a **work** or **edit**
 * [[chat]], a project); its colour says the single most important *state* — a sync
 * **conflict** to resolve, the agent **working**, a turn that **errored**, or changes
 * waiting for **review**; and a conflict carries a `!` mark.
 *
 * Idle rows show a quiet, uncoloured glyph — information on demand
 * (`experience/README.md`): the gem only lights when there is something to know.
 *
 * The lights fold two sources: the live client run-tone (`working`/`error`/`review`)
 * and the per-chat projection status (`conflict`/`changes`, WS-H b/c). {@link gemState}
 * resolves them with a fixed precedence and is unit-tested.
