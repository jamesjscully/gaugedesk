/**
 * The mobile **inline merge/review approval flow** (`mobile-client.md`, MOB-031):
 * the pure state machine the {@link ChatApprovalCard} island reduces over when a
 * turn surfaces a *result that needs approval* in the chat transcript. On the
 * desktop this is the {@link ReviewShelf} (conjunctive consent → clear → release);
 * on a phone the same review lifecycle rides *inline in the chat stop*, as a card
 * threaded between the turns that produced it — the carousel has no second shelf.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the one the rest of the client already speaks — the review
 * {@link ReviewPhase} (`control-plane.ts`, mirroring `gaugewright_core::review`). A card
 * walks the same arc the core reducer walks server-side: `Init` (nothing to
 * approve) → an agent proposes → `Proposed` (the required parties must each
 * consent) → every required party consents → `Cleared` → the user releases →
 * `Released` (terminal), or the proposal is withdrawn → `Withheld` (terminal). The
 * flow never manufactures a clearance: it is `Cleared` only once *every* required
 * party's consent is in (the conjunctive `INV-7` rule the core reducer enforces),
 * and `Released` only once the server's review state says so (mirrors
 * `access-request.ts`'s `granted ⇔ server phase` discipline; `principles.md`,
 * `INV-5`/`INV-7`).
 *
 * Like the rest of the mobile client (`access-request.ts`, `mobile-composer.ts`,
 * `connection.ts`) this is a thin, DOM-free pure layer: every "what may the user
 * do, and what do we show?" decision is a pure function here, and the
 * {@link ChatApprovalCard} island only wires Solid signals and DOM events onto it.
 * The transport (the actual `consent` / `release` command) is the host's; this
 * module decides nothing about the network beyond folding the phase it is handed.
 *
 * The optimistic-reconcile correlation id (`ClientRequestId`, MOB-003) travels
 * with a pending consent/release so the host can retire the optimistic entry when
 * the review projection that answers it lands.
