/**
 * The mobile **Chat composer** (`mobile-client.md`, MOB-020): the draft → send /
 * stop control shown at the `chat` carousel stop, beneath the live transcript.
 * Sending is one of the few *commands* the client may issue (`mobile-client.md`,
 * "Projection-first compliance"); the rest of the carousel is local view state.
 *
 * Like {@link MobileFiles} / {@link MobileContent} / {@link Carousel} this is a
 * thin renderer: every "may I send? may I stop? what does this draft become?"
 * decision is a pure function in `mobile-composer.ts` (`presentComposer`,
 * `send`, `reconcile`). The island only wires Solid's events onto that derived
 * presentation and routes the resulting state back through the host via
 * {@link MobileChatProps.onState} — it owns no truth and decides no liveness
 * itself. The optimistic pending ledger surfaces as an unobtrusive in-flight
 * caption (a send is *non-standing* until the environment confirms, `INV-5`).
