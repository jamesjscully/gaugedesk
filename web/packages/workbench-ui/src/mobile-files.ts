/**
 * The mobile **Files pane's** view-derived vocabulary (`mobile-client.md`,
 * MOB-015): the small, pure projections the {@link MobileFiles} island needs to
 * paint a worktree tree where **a handle's name is always visible but its
 * payload is not** (`INV-10`, mirrors `gaugewright_core::resource_access`:
 * `name_visible()` is always true, `payload_accessible()` only once `Granted`).
 *
 * The island is a thin renderer; all the "what may I show?" decisions live here
 * as pure functions of the supplied file nodes, so this layer is testable
 * without a DOM (same split as the carousel: `carousel-view.ts` vs
 * `CarouselIsland.tsx`). The cardinal rule this module encodes: **holding a handle is
 * not holding the payload** — the tree lists every file by name, but a node's
 * content is openable only when its access phase grants the payload.
