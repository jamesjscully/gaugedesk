/**
 * Make fork lineage legible (round-8 #3).
 *
 * A forked chat is created (by the backend) with a "(fork)" suffix on its title —
 * e.g. "hello kitt (fork)". In the tree it then sits as a flat sibling of its
 * source, distinguished ONLY by that suffix, so "hello kitt" and "hello kitt
 * (fork)" look like coincidental name-twins: nothing shows one is a *copy* of the
 * other, or what carried over (files come along; the conversation starts fresh —
 * established round 1 #2).
 *
 * The frontend can't see a real parent pointer (the recent projection carries only
 * id/title/archetype/kind/mode), but the "(fork)" suffix is a reliable signal we
 * own. These pure helpers read it so the row can show a quiet "copy of {source}"
 * sublabel and the fork's first view can explain the copy-semantics — without any
 * backend change.
