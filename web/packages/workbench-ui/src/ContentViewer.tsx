/**
 * The content viewer/editor (3rd column, `navigation.md`): renders the selected
 * worktree file, or the turn's diff. Toggle above the area: **View · Edit · Diff**.
 *
 * The **Edit** tab is a full-panel editor with the **save** button top-right
 * (`Ctrl/Cmd+S` also saves). Editing undo/redo is the textarea's native, in-buffer
 * undo (`Ctrl+Z`). Each save commits to the engagement branch, so **git is the
 * file's durable version history** — surfaced through the Diff / promote-to-main
 * surface below, not a separate per-file history.
 *
 * The **Diff** is the *review surface for the merge lifecycle* (D1): the human
 * reviews the engagement-vs-`main` diff and **admits** (advance main) or
 * **rejects** (isolate); a conflict surfaces with repair/retry.
