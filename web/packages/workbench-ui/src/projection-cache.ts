/**
 * Offline projection cache — the client's last-known-good store for projections
 * it has already received, so the carousel can render *something* while offline
 * or between refreshes (`mobile-client.md`, "Offline & freshness"; MOB-017).
 *
 * The doctrine carried from the core (`gaugewright_core::freshness`, ADR 0037): a
 * cached projection must never silently read as current. A value served from the
 * cache is, by construction, no longer connected to the live admitted basis the
 * moment it is stored — so on **read** the cache *decays* its freshness against
 * the supplied clock: a `live` carriage that has aged past the stale threshold
 * comes back marked `stale`, and one past the hard TTL comes back
 * `indeterminate` (the cache can no longer vouch for its currentness at all). A
 * non-live carriage never decays *upward*; the cache only ever lowers
 * confidence, never raises it. This is the read-side mirror of `is_current`:
 * only a `live` carriage may be presented as truth, and the cache can only mint
 * one by storing it *and* reading it back within the stale window.
 *
 * The store is an injected `CacheStorage` (the `localStorage` shape) so this
 * module stays pure and framework-agnostic (tested without a DOM, like the rest
 * of `state/`); the Solid shell hands it the real `window.localStorage`.
