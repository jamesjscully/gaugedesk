/**
 * The client's **pairing flow** (`mobile-client.md`, "Pairing", MOB-026): the
 * pure state machine the {@link PairingFlow} island reduces over while a device
 * binds itself to an environment. A pairing ticket — scanned from a QR code or
 * typed as a short code — is submitted to the owner's `POST /pairing-requests`
 * endpoint, which opens a `DeviceBinding` boundary and returns a `pairing_id`;
 * the client then polls `GET /pairing-status/:id` until the owner accepts and the
 * boundary goes `Active` (`crates/app/src/library_routes.rs`, MOB-027). The end
 * of a successful flow is the grant this device now holds — the connection state
 * machine's `grants-changed` input (`connection.ts`, MOB-018).
 *
 * Like the rest of the mobile client (`mobile-content.ts`, `mobile-composer.ts`,
 * `connection.ts`) this is a thin, DOM-free pure layer: every "what step are we
 * on, and what may the user do?" decision is a pure function here, and the
 * {@link PairingFlow} island only wires Solid signals and DOM events onto it. The
 * transport (the two fetches) is the shell's; this module decides nothing about
 * the network beyond folding the wire status it is handed.
 *
 * The step vocabulary mirrors the boundary phases the server reports verbatim
 * (`gaugewright_core::boundary_lifecycle::BoundaryPhase`): a freshly bound pairing sits
 * at `DeviceBinding` (awaiting the owner's acceptance); the owner accepting moves
 * the boundary to `Active`, which the client reads as `paired` and the flow as
 * done. The flow never manufactures the paired fact — it is `paired` only once the
 * server's status says so (`paired === state.active()`; `principles.md`, `INV-5`).
