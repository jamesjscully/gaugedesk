/**
 * The mobile **Carousel island** (`mobile-client.md`, MOB-014): the four desktop
 * panels — `nav · chat · files · content` — shown one at a time on a phone, with
 * the same left→right *broad → deep* order. It is a thin renderer: it owns *no*
 * navigation truth. The pure swipe-depth reducer (MOB-009) decides every
 * transition, the view-derived helpers (MOB-014 `carousel-view`) decide the
 * toggle / peek / gutter paint, and this component only wires Solid signals and
 * DOM events onto them (`navigation.md`: the client renders projections and
 * submits gestures, never a lifecycle transition).
 *
 *   ┌ top toggle:  nav  [ chat ]  files  content ───────────────┐
 *   │ ‹ gutter │            current pane                │ gutter ›│
 *   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Each pane is supplied as a render-prop so the island stays projection-agnostic
 * — `MobileFiles` (MOB-015), `MobileContent` (MOB-016), the chat composer
 * (MOB-020) and the nav facet all slot in here without the island knowing their
 * internals. The toggle is the *canonical, labelled* control; the edge gutters
 * are a discoverable shortcut for the same gestures.
