# GaugeBench

GaugeBench is a free, event-sourced, projection-first desktop workbench for
governed, multi-party agentic work — a way to apply external expertise to
private operational context under review, release, and audit controls.

This repository is the open, source-available distribution of the GaugeBench
platform.

## What's here

- **Core crates** — `crates/core` (pure, property-tested reducers), `crates/store`
  (SQLite event log + admission), `crates/workspace` (git instance/worktrees),
  `crates/boundary` (the egress membrane), `crates/pi-bridge` (drives
  `pi --mode rpc`), and `crates/app` (engine orchestrator + axum control plane).
- **Desktop shell** — `src-tauri/` (its own Cargo workspace).
- **Web** — `web/` (workbench, mobile, `workbench-ui`, `control-plane-client`,
  `gw-embed`) and the enterprise web workspace under `ee/web/`.
- **Enterprise (`ee/`)** — org/SSO/OIDC/SAML, SCIM, RBAC, enterprise audit
  (`ee/app`), and the SAML verifier sidecar (`ee/sidecar/saml-verify`).
- **Federation protocol** and the open Pi membrane plugin (`plugin/`).
- **Docs** — `docs/`, rendered to the documentation site.

## Download

Prebuilt desktop bundles — Linux `.deb`/`.AppImage`, macOS `.dmg`, Windows `.msi`
— are on the [releases page](https://github.com/jamesjscully/gaugebench/releases).
Installers are currently unsigned.

## Licensing

Two license bands, split by directory:

- Everything outside `ee/` is **Apache-2.0** — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and
  [`NOTICE`](NOTICE).
- Everything under `ee/` is **Business Source License 1.1** with the GaugeWright
  Enterprise Use Grant — see [`ee/LICENSE`](ee/LICENSE). It is publicly readable
  by design; production use is governed by the BUSL terms.

## Quick start

```sh
# Backend
cargo test --workspace

# Web client
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev                     # dev server
npm run typecheck && npm run test
```

## Verifying the security claims

GaugeBench's protection model is structural, and much of it is machine-checked.
[Verifying the security claims](docs/reference/verifying-claims.md) maps each
guarantee to the executable tests in this repository that exercise it. The formal
Quint models those tests are derived from are maintained in a separate private
repository; the tests that check the same properties are public here.
